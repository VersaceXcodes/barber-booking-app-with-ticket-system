When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.
