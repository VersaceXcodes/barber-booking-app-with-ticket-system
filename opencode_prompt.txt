The current landing page has reverted to an old blue design (headline “Master Your Perfect Fade”, blue gradient background, “Book Your Cut Now” button, etc.).

I want to completely restore the new red “Master Fade” public design and keep all the new booking features (walk-in queue, live wait, call-outs, etc.). Do NOT use the blue template anywhere on the public landing page.

Do the following:

1. Use the RED design as the ONLY correct landing page

Replace the current blue hero with the red version that looks like this:

Dark red patterned background.

“Master Fade” logo in the top-left, with “Premium Barbers” subtitle.

Top nav: Home | Services | Call-Outs | Gallery | Live Queue | Login.

Hero headline (left):

Skip the Wait.

Look Sharp.

Subheadline:

“Premium cuts, zero hassle. Book in 60 seconds or join our virtual queue.”

Two buttons below the text:

Book Appointment (solid white / primary)

Join Walk-In Queue (outlined).

Small reassurance text below buttons:

“✓ Instant confirmation • ✓ Free cancellation • ✓ 500+ happy clients”

Stats card on the right with three items:

500+ Happy Clients

4.9 Star Rating

Current Wait: [dynamic text, e.g. “No Wait” or “15 Mins”]

This red layout (with “Skip the Wait. Look Sharp.” and the two buttons) must be the canonical public hero.
Do not use: blue gradient background, “Master Your Perfect Fade” headline, “Book Your Cut Now” button, or the old wavy bottom edge. Remove all of that from the public landing page.

2. Remove old blue landing components

Find all components/sections/layouts that belong to the blue theme (blue gradient, blue CTA button, “Master Your Perfect Fade” text, “Dublin’s Premier Barbershop” pill, etc.).

Delete them or stop rendering them on the public site.

Ensure the main route (/ or public homepage) renders only the red “Skip the Wait. Look Sharp.” layout.

3. Re-integrate the new booking features into the RED design

Make sure the following features still work and are wired into the red hero:

Book Appointment button:

Opens the advanced booking / normal appointment flow (multi-step or form) with service, date, time, details, and optional barber selection.

Join Walk-In Queue button:

Opens the light walk-in queue join form (name + phone + optional barber).

On submit, shows the proper confirmation screen with ticket number, position, and estimated wait.

Also updates the live queue and the “Current Wait” metric.

Current Wait card:

Uses dynamic data from the wait-time system (appointments + walk-in queue + active barbers).

Shows text like “No Wait” or “15 Mins” with the same styling as before.

Call-Outs nav item:

Appears as a normal nav link, styled like other nav items (no bright orange background).

Navigates to the dedicated Call-Out page with the €150 house-call booking form.

Do all of this inside the red layout and style – do not bring back any blue UI elements.

4. Preserve multi-barber + admin logic, but don’t touch the public aesthetic

Keep the Barber model and admin ability to add/edit barbers and mark isWorkingToday.

Keep the assignment of a barber to:

Appointments

Call-Out bookings

Walk-In queue entries

Integrate barber selection into the existing red forms (as you already did), without changing the look of the hero / landing.

Do not change the public landing page color scheme, fonts, or layout when you add/edit the barber logic.

5. Style & theme rules

The global public theme must be the dark red Master Fade design, not the blue one.

If there is any conflict between blue styles and red styles, always choose the red theme.

Do not import or reuse any old blue template styles, components, or layouts on the public side.

In summary:

Completely remove the blue “Master Your Perfect Fade” hero from the public homepage.

Restore the red “Skip the Wait. Look Sharp.” hero with Book Appointment + Join Walk-In Queue + Current Wait card.

Keep all the new functionality (walk-in queue, call-outs, multi-barber, dynamic wait time) but make it live inside the red design only.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "The current landing page has reverted to an old blue design (headline “Master Your Perfect Fade”, blue gradient background, “Book Your Cut Now” button, etc.).
