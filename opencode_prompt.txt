The site currently has an inconsistent design system:

The landing page uses the new blood-red Master Fade theme, which is correct.

Other pages (Bookings flow, Dashboard, Customers, Services, etc.) still use the old blue/light theme or mixed designs.

I want you to fully unify the design system.

1. Define the NEW global theme (based on the landing page)

This theme should be applied across the entire app unless stated otherwise.

Global color palette (use these site-wide):

Primary background: deep blood-red gradient with subtle texture

Secondary background: darker maroon panels

Accents:

Warm reds/oranges (for highlights, active states, badges)

Soft gold for premium indicators

Text colors:

White / light gray for main text

Soft gray for secondary text

Border radiuses: rounded, same as landing page

Shadows: soft ambient glows like on the landing page cards

Icons: outlined, minimalist, matching landing page style

Typography

Use the exact font family, weights, and spacing from the landing page across all pages

Headings should match the bold landing page style

Body text: light gray, medium weight

This landing page theme becomes the official global UI system.

2. Apply this theme to ALL pages

Update the following so they visually match the landing page:

Bookings / Appointment Flow

Call-Outs page

Live Queue page

Services

Gallery

Customers

Barbers

Bookings admin pages

Dashboard

Settings

Replace all of the following old elements:

Light blue backgrounds

Blue buttons

Gray/white empty layouts

Old card styles

Old shadows

Old navbar spacing

White/blue headers

Make sure no page uses the old design components or styles.

3. Give each page its own variation while staying on brand

Each page should look unique but still part of the Master Fade identity.

Examples:
Dashboard

Use darker maroon background panels

Gold or orange accent highlights for “statistics”

Use the rounded, soft-shadow cards from the landing page

Replace green/blue stat cards with maroon variants

Customers page

Keep a clean table layout but use:

Maroon header bar

Darker red row hover states

Light gray text on dark backgrounds

Red/gold pill tags instead of blue

Bookings page

Use blood-red themed progress steps (Service → Date → Time → Details)

Replace blue selection glow with orange/red outline and soft shadow

Replace light-blue service cards with darker maroon cards

Live Queue

Match the dark red landing page card style

Use green accents ONLY for “No Wait” or positive states

Background should match landing page pattern

Call-Outs page

Premium aesthetic (slightly more gold accents)

Dark rich maroons

Highlight €150 with a premium badge

Match spacing and typography used in landing page hero

4. Navbar & Footer

Navbar must match landing page styling everywhere (dark red background, white text, subtle underline on hover).

Remove the orange “CALL-OUTS” pill style unless intentionally part of the theme — replace with subtle red hover or gold small badge.

Keep the Master Fade logo and spacing the same everywhere.

5. Replace all legacy blue/light UI components

Search the project for any old components or design tokens and replace them with:

blood-red backgrounds

maroon cards

red/orange/gold accents

landing-page typography

dark backgrounds for admin tables and cards

Ensure no page inherits default blue/light themes.

6. Keep functionality exactly the same

Do not revert or remove features such as:

Multi-barber support

Live walk-in queue

Call-outs booking

Dynamic wait calculation

Admin dashboard tools

This change is visual only unless styling requires minor layout fixes.

7. Consistency rules

If a conflict arises between design systems:
Always match the landing page theme: blood-red, premium, modern, dark.

Implement these changes so the entire app feels like one cohesive brand, visually aligned with the landing page, while giving each page its own personality within the same red Master Fade theme.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "The site currently has an inconsistent design system:
