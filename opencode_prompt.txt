1. Improve text readability everywhere

Increase contrast between text and background — especially on:

The dark red gradient sections

Calendar cells

Cards with semi-transparent backgrounds

Admin table rows

Ensure all headings, labels, buttons, and body text meet WCAG AA contrast minimums.

Lighten page backgrounds slightly where needed to avoid low-contrast grey text.

Do not change the brand colors — only adjust shades for visibility.

2. Make the color system consistent across ALL pages

Apply a unified theme derived from the landing page:

Primary: deep barbershop red (#600000 to #8b0000 gradient)
Secondary: warm dark brown / burgundy
Accent: bright red/orange for highlights
Success / Good: barbershop green
Surface cards: slightly lighter or blurred burgundy—not pure black

Pages that must use this updated palette consistently:

Barber Management

Bookings Calendar

Daily Booking View

Services Setup

Call-Outs

Settings

Customers

Dashboard

These should feel like they belong to the same brand as the landing page.

3. Update surfaces for better readability

For cards, tables, modals, and calendars:

Use lighter burgundy or blurred glass panels rather than near-black backgrounds.

Avoid pure dark red backgrounds under small text; instead use tinted surfaces.

Add subtle shadows to separate cards from backgrounds.

4. Improve calendar readability

Fix:

Light grey text that turns invisible on pale backgrounds

Days and numbers that blend into the gradient
Apply:

Stronger day labels

Clearer appointment availability text

Hover states with defined outlines

5. Improve toggles, tags, badges, and labels

Ensure toggle labels “Working Today” / “Active Status” are readable.

Increase contrast of specialty tags.

Ensure green “Available” text is readable on light backgrounds.

6. Keep layouts EXACTLY the same — only improve styling

Do not change structure, spacing, card layout, or feature placement.
Only improve:

Colors

Opacity

Contrast

Readability

Consistency

Goal Summary

Make the entire UI visually consistent, easier on the eyes, more accessible, and fully aligned with the premium red theme from the landing page, without losing any functionality or layout.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "1. Improve text readability everywhere
