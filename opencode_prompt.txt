The Vite build process failed. Analyze the error output below and fix the issue.

## Build Error Output:
```
NODE_ENV=production is not supported in the .env file. Only NODE_ENV=development is supported to create a development build of your project. If you need to set process.env.NODE_ENV, you can set it in the Vite config instead.

error during build:
[vite:load-fallback] Could not load /app/vitereact/src/components/ui/switch (imported by src/components/views/UV_AdminBarbersList.tsx): ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/app/vitereact/src/components/ui/switch'
Error: Could not load /app/vitereact/src/components/ui/switch (imported by src/components/views/UV_AdminBarbersList.tsx): ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/app/vitereact/src/components/ui/switch'

## Build Directory: /app/vitereact

## Your Task:
1. **Analyze the Error**: Read the error output carefully to understand what went wrong
2. **Locate the Problem**: Find the file(s) mentioned in the error
3. **Apply the Fix**: 
   - Missing file/component? CREATE it with correct exports
   - Wrong import path? FIX the import statement  
   - Syntax error? FIX the syntax in the affected file
   - Type error? FIX the TypeScript types
   - Missing dependency? Check if it needs to be installed or if it's a local import issue
4. **Verify**: After fixing, ensure all imports resolve correctly

## IMPORTANT:
- The build CANNOT succeed until this error is fixed
- If creating a missing component, ensure exports match what's being imported (default vs named)
- If the error mentions a specific line number, check that line in the source file
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` after fixing to verify no TypeScript errors remain

Fix this error so the build can succeed on retry.
